# Standard library

The Plume standard library is a key feature of the language as it brings exciting functions and global features. The standard library is a collection of functions and types that are available to all Plume programs. The standard library is divided into several modules, each of which provides a set of related functionality.

It has been designed to be fully type-safe and runtime-safe, meaning that a program that compiles using standard library functions, will not crash *normally* at runtime.

> **Note:** The Plume code is designed to be safe, however, it is still possible to write a code that will crash at runtime because of some compiler issues. If you find such a case, please report it to the Plume team.
